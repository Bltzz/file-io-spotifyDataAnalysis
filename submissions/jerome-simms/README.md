# Spotify Data Logger

## Challenges Completed
I have completed the following tasks:
- Write a script to identify the number of songs in the file.
- Write a script that identify the number of songs in the key of E.
- Count the occurrences of values in a specified column (e.g., artist names) and determine the most common value.

## How to Run
In order to run my solution, I am assuming a unix operating system or a system capable of running bash commands.
I also assume that you have access to the `g++` command.

The most simple way to run this program is to type the following in your terminal once you have navigated from the project root to the file-io/submissions/jerome-simms directory:
```bash
g++ main.cpp SpotifyDataSolver.cpp
./a.out
```
